# 1.Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly*** **one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


### Brute Force
```
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i,j]
```
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n^2). For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes O(n)O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).

Space complexity: O(1). The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.


### Optimal Solution
To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n)O(n) to O(1)O(1) by trading space for speed. A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n)O(n) time. However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1)O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.
```
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        hashTable = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in hashTable:
                return [hashTable[complement], i]
            hashTable[nums[i]] = i
```
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n). We traverse the list containing nn elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces the lookup time to O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space complexity: O(n). The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly nn elements.



### Another Solution
```
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
        sorted_idx = sorted(range(len(nums)), key=lambda k: nums[k])
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            sum = sorted_nums[l] + sorted_nums[r]
            if sum == target:
                return [sorted_idx[l],sorted_idx[r]]
            elif sum < target:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
```
