# 994. Rotting Oranges

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png)

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.


## Solution: BFS

```python3
from collections import deque 

class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        fresh_cnt = 0
        rotten = deque()

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    fresh_cnt += 1
                elif grid[i][j] == 2:
                    rotten.append((i, j))

        count = 0
        while rotten and fresh_cnt > 0:
            count += 1
            for i in range(len(rotten)):
                row, column = rotten.popleft()
                for nr, nc in [(row, column + 1), (row, column - 1), (row + 1, column), (row - 1, column)]:
                    if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                        grid[nr][nc] = 2
                        fresh_cnt -= 1
                        rotten.append((nr, nc))

        return count if fresh_cnt == 0 else -1
```
