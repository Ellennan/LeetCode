# 62. Unique Paths

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`


## Approach 1: DP

```python3
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[1] * n for i in range(m)]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]

        return dp[-1][-1]

```
## Approach 2: Memory-Optimized DP

```python3
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1 for i in range(n)]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[j] += dp[j - 1]

        return dp[-1]
        
```

## Approach 3: Combinatorial Mathematics

Combinatorial Formula: ${m+n-2}\choose{m-1}$ or ${m+n-2}\choose{n-1}$
â€‹	
```python3
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return math.comb(m + n - 2, m - 1)
```
