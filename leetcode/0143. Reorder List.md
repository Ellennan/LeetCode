# 143. Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

> $L_0 → L_1 → … → L_{n - 1} → L_n$

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

> $L_0 → L_n → L_1 → L_{n - 1} → L_2 → L_{n - 2} → …$

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- 1 <= Node.val <= 1000


## Solution

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        slow = head
        fast = head.next

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        prev = None
        curr = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        
        first = head
        second = prev
        while second:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2
```
