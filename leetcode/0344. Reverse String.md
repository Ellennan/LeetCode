# 344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is a **printable ascii character**.

## Solution

```python3
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1
        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
```

## Other solutions

```python3
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s.reverse()
```
.reverse() reverse existing lists in place

```python3
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        s[:] = s[::-1]
```

s[:] = s[::-1] is required NOT s = s[::-1] because you have to edit the list inplace.

Although the operation performs the reversal in-place and does not create a new list, it still requires temporary space to store the reversed elements before updating the original list.

When s[::-1] is executed, it creates a new list with the reversed elements of s. This new list requires O(n) additional space to store the reversed elements.

The assignment s[:] = s[::-1] reuses the existing memory space of s to store the reversed elements, so the overall space complexity remains O(n).
