# 547. Number of Provinces

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the $i^{th}$ city and the $j^{th}$ city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph1.jpg)

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/24/graph2.jpg)
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

## Approach 1: Graph DFS

```python3
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)

        def dfs(i):
            isConnected[i][i] = -1
            for j in range(n):
                if isConnected[i][j] == 1:
                    isConnected[i][j] = -1
                    dfs(j)

        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if isConnected[i][i] == 1:
                count += 1
                dfs(i)
        
        return count
```

## Approach 2: Union Find

```python3
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)
        root = [i for i in range(n)]

        def union(x,y):
            Rx = root[x]
            Ry = root[y]

            if(Rx != Ry):
                for i in range(n):
                    if root[i] == Ry:
                        root[i] = Rx

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if isConnected[i][j] == 1:
                    union(i,j)
            
        return len(set(root))
```
