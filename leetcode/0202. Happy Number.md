# 202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` *if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach 1: Hashset

```python3
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        nums = set()
        while n != 1:
            n = sum([int(i) ** 2 for i in str(n)])
            if n in nums:
                return False
            nums.add(n)
        return True
```

## Approach 2: Floyd Cycle detection algorithm

```python3
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        slow = fast = n
        while fast != 1: 
            slow = sum([int(i) ** 2 for i in str(slow)])
            fast = sum([int(i) ** 2 for i in str(fast)])
            fast = sum([int(i) ** 2 for i in str(fast)])
            if slow == fast:
                break
        return fast == 1
```
