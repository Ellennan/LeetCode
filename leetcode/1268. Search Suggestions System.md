# 1268. Search Suggestions System

You are given an array of strings products and a string searchWord.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"].
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"].
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
Explanation: The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`
- All the strings of `products` are **unique**.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.


## Approach 1: Brute Force

```python3
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        results = []
        for i in range(len(searchWord)):
            prefix = searchWord[:i + 1]
            result = []
            j = 0
            while j < len(products) and len(result) < 3:
                if products[j][:i + 1] == prefix:
                    result.append(products[j])
                j += 1
            results.append(result)
        
        return results
```

## Approach 2: Binary Search

```python3
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        results = []
        for i in range(len(searchWord)):
            prefix = searchWord[:i + 1]
            l, r = 0, len(products) - 1
            while l <= r:
                mid = (l + r) // 2
                if products[mid][:i + 1] < prefix:
                    l = mid + 1
                elif products[mid][:i + 1] >= prefix:
                    r = mid - 1
            result = [p for p in products[l:min(l + 3, len(products))] if p[:i + 1] == prefix]
            results.append(result)
        
        return results
```

> 
> * Space complexity: O(logm) for sorting buffer.


## Approach3: bisect_left

```python3
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        results = []
        for i in range(len(searchWord)):
            prefix = searchWord[:i + 1]
            l = bisect_left(products, prefix, 0, len(products))
            result = [p for p in products[l:l + 3] if p[:i + 1] == prefix]
            results.append(result)
        
        return results
```

## Approach 4: Trie

```python3
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = dict()
        self.words = list()
        self.n = 0

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def add_word(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[c]
            if node.n < 3:
                node.words.append(word)
                node.n += 1
    
    def find_word_by_prefix(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in node.children:
                return []
            node = node.children[c]
        return node.words


class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        trie = Trie()
        for product in products:
            trie.add_word(product)
        
        res = []
        prefix = ""
        for c in searchWord:
            prefix += c
            res.append(trie.find_word_by_prefix(prefix))
        return res
```

> **Complexity Analysis**
> 
> * Time complexity: O(mlogm + T + n ^ 2). Where T is total number of characters in products, i.e., sum(products[i].length), m is the number of elements in products, and n is the length of searchWord.
> 
> * Space complexity: O(logm + T). Where T is total number of characters in products for building Trie.


## Approach 5: Optimised Trie

```python3
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = dict()
        self.words = list()
        self.n = 0

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.node = self.root
    
    def add_word(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in node.children:
                node.children[c] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[c]
            if node.n < 3:
                node.words.append(word)
                node.n += 1
    
    def find_word_by_prefix(self, c):
        if self.node and c in self.node.children:
            self.node = self.node.children[c]
            return self.node.words
        else:
            self.node = None
            return []


class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        trie = Trie()
        for product in products:
            trie.add_word(product)

        return [trie.find_word_by_prefix(c) for c in searchWord]
```
