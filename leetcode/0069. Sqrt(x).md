# 69. Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`


## Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return x

        l, r = 1, x

        while r - l > 1:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid < x:
                l = mid
            else:
                r = mid

        return l
```

**Thought:** The condition for exiting the loop is `r = l + 1`. The rule of updating l and r is to let `l * l < x` and `r * r > x`. This problem requires to return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer, so we should return l.

## Solution 2

```python3
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return x

        l, r = 1, x

        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid < x:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1

        return r
```

**Thought:** The condition of last while loop is `l == r`. We only need to think about what happen in last while loop. 

`mid = (l + r) // 2 = l = r`

- If mid * mid < x, we should return this `mid` value. l is updated to mid + 1, while r remains mid, so return r;
- If mid * mid > x, we should return `mid - 1`, which is also r.
