# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`
- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Approach 1

```python3
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            if haystack[i:i+len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1
```

> **Complexity Analysis**
>
> - Time complexity: O(m * n).
>
> - Space complexity: O(n), where n is needle.length. haystack[i:i+len(needle)] create a new list.

## Approach 2

```python3
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):
            j = 0
            while j < len(needle):
                if haystack[i + j] != needle[j]:
                    break
                j += 1
            if j == len(needle):
                return i
        return -1
```

> **Complexity Analysis**
>
> - Time complexity: O(m * n).
>
> - Space complexity: O(1).

## Approach 3: Built-in function

```python3
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        return haystack.find(needle)
```

> **Complexity Analysis**
>
> - Time complexity: O(m * n).
> The find method in Python is implemented using the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which has an average time complexity of O(n/m).
> In the worst case, the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * m), which occurs when the needle has to be compared against every possible position in the haystack.
>
> - Space complexity: O(1).
