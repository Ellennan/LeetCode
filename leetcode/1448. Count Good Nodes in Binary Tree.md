# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)

```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.


## Solution

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        def dfs(root, max_val):
            if root == None:
                return 0
            
            current = 0
            if root.val >= max_val:
                max_val = root.val
                current = 1

            return current + dfs(root.left, max_val) + dfs(root.right, max_val)

        return dfs(root, root.val)
```
