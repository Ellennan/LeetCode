# 200. Number of Islands

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.


## Solution

```python3
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # DFS surrounding lands
        def dfs(i, j):
            if  0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j] == "1":
                grid[i][j] = "*"
                dfs(i - 1, j)   # Top
                dfs(i + 1, j)   # Down
                dfs(i, j - 1)   # Left
                dfs(i, j + 1)   #Â Right

        cnt = 0
        # Iterate all grids
        for i in range(len(grid)): # Row
            for j in range(len(grid[0])): # Column
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    cnt += 1
                    dfs(i, j)

        return cnt
```
