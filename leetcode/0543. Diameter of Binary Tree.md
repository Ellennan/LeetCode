# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.diameter = 0

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.depth(root)
        return self.diameter
    
    def depth(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0

        left = self.depth(node.left)
        right = self.depth(node.right)

        self.diameter = max(self.diameter, left + right)

        return 1 + max(left, right)
```

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        diameter = 0

        def depth(node: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
            nonlocal diameter
            if not node:
                return 0

            left = depth(node.left)
            right = depth(node.right)

            diameter = max(diameter, left + right)
            
            return 1 + max(left, right)
        
        depth(root)
        return diameter
```
