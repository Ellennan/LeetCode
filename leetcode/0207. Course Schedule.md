# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where $prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]$ indicates that you must take course $b_i$ first if you want to take course $a_i$.

- For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

## Solution: Topological sorting - DFS

Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Depth-first_search

```python3
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        adj = {i:[] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for course, pre in prerequisites:
            adj[course].append(pre)

        no_cycle = set()
        visited = set()
        def dfs(i):
            if i in visited:
                return False
            if i in no_cycle:
                return True
            
            visited.add(i)
            for pre in adj[i]:
                if not dfs(pre): return False
            visited.remove(i)
            no_cycle.add(i)
            return True
        
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False
        return True
```
