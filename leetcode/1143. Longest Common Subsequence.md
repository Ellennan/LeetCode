# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.


## Approach 1: DP

```python3
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        n = len(text1)
        m = len(text2)
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])

        return dp[i][j]
```

## Approach 2: DP - Space Optimization

```python3
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        n = len(text1)
        m = len(text2)
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(2)]

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                idx = i % 2
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[idx][j] = dp[1 - idx][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[idx][j] = max(dp[1 - idx][j], dp[idx][j - 1])

        return dp[idx][j]
```

## Approach 3: Recursion
***:x: Time Limit Exceeded***

```python3
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        n = len(text1)
        m = len(text2)
        return self.longestCommonSuffix(text1, text2, n, m)

    def longestCommonSuffix(self, text1, text2, i, j):
        if i == 0 or j == 0:
            return 0
        if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
            return self.longestCommonSuffix(text1, text2, i - 1, j - 1) + 1
        else:
            return max(
                self.longestCommonSuffix(text1, text2, i - 1, j),
                self.longestCommonSuffix(text1, text2, i, j - 1),
            )
```
