# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( `a` OR `b` == `c` ). (bitwise OR operation).

Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.


**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/06/sample_3_1676.png)

```
Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a <= 10^9`
- `1 <= b <= 10^9`
- `1 <= c <= 10^9`


## Approach 1: Brute Force

```python3
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        binary_a = bin(a)[2:]
        binary_b = bin(b)[2:]
        binary_c = bin(c)[2:]
        maxlength = len(bin(max(a, b, c))[2:])
        binary_a = "0" * (maxlength - len(binary_a)) + binary_a
        binary_b = "0" * (maxlength - len(binary_b)) + binary_b
        binary_c = "0" * (maxlength - len(binary_c)) + binary_c

        count = 0
        for i in range(maxlength):
            if binary_c[i] == "0":
                count += int(binary_a[i]) + int(binary_b[i])
            elif not (int(binary_a[i]) or int(binary_b[i])):
                count += 1

        return count
```

## Approach 2: Bit Manipulation

```python3
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        flips = 0
        while a > 0 or b > 0 or c > 0:
            bit_a = a & 1
            bit_b = b & 1
            bit_c = c & 1

            if bit_c == 0:
                flips += bit_a + bit_b
            elif bit_a == 0 and bit_b == 0:
                flips += 1

            a = a >> 1
            b = b >> 1
            c = c >> 1

        return flips
```

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| & | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 | x & y |
| \| | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 | x \| y |
| ^ | XOR |	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 |	x ^ y|	
| ~ |	NOT |	Inverts all the bits | ~x |	
| << | Zero fill left shift |	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off | x << 2 |	
| >> | Signed right shift | Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |	x >> 2 |
