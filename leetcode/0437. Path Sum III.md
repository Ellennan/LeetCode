# 437. Path Sum III

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`


## Solution

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        count = 0
    
        def dfs(root, target, start):
            nonlocal count

            if not root:
                return

            if root.val == target:
                print(root.val)
                count += 1

            dfs(root.left, target - root.val, False)
            dfs(root.right, target - root.val, False)

            if start:
                dfs(root.left, targetSum, True)
                dfs(root.right, targetSum, True)
        
        dfs(root, targetSum, True)

        return count
```

> Explanation for what the boolean of start does:
>
> At each node, you have an option either to continue on the previous sum (dfs(root.left/right, False, target)), or start a fresh sum completely by starting off again from sum (this part is dfs(root.left/right, True, targetSum) part).
>
> However, for each node, you can only start a fresh sum only once, otherwise it will keep counting duplicate counts when node.val == target.
>
> To prevent that and to ensure that you start the fresh sum only once, you have a start boolean to denote whether you continue on the previous chain (False in this case) or you start a new chain (True). Because we only run dfs to children with True only when the parent is True, it is guaranteed that each node will only be visited once with True, and we know for sure that there will only be one fresh new start for all nodes in the tree.
