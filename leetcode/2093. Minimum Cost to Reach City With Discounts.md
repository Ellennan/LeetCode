# 2093. Minimum Cost to Reach City With Discounts

A series of highways connect `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `highways` where `highways[i] = [city1_i, city2_i, toll_i]` indicates that there is a highway that connects `city1_i` and `city2_i`, allowing a car to go from `city1_i` to `city2_i` and vice versa for a cost of `toll_i`.

You are also given an integer `discounts` which represents the number of discounts you have. You can use a discount to travel across the `i^th` highway for a cost of `toll_i / 2` (**integer division**). Each discount may only be used **once**, and you can only use at most **one** discount per highway.

Return the **minimum total cost** to go from city `0` to city `n - 1`, or `-1` if it is not possible to go from city `0` to city `n - 1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, highways = [[0,1,4],[2,1,3],[1,4,11],[3,2,3],[3,4,2]], discounts = 1
Output: 9
Explanation:
Go from 0 to 1 for a cost of 4.
Go from 1 to 4 and use a discount for a cost of 11 / 2 = 5.
The minimum cost to go from 0 to 4 is 4 + 5 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, highways = [[1,3,17],[1,2,7],[3,2,5],[0,1,6],[3,0,20]], discounts = 20
Output: 8
Explanation:
Go from 0 to 1 and use a discount for a cost of 6 / 2 = 3.
Go from 1 to 2 and use a discount for a cost of 7 / 2 = 3.
Go from 2 to 3 and use a discount for a cost of 5 / 2 = 2.
The minimum cost to go from 0 to 3 is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4, highways = [[0,1,3],[2,3,2]], discounts = 0
Output: -1
Explanation:
It is impossible to go from 0 to 3 so return -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= highways.length <= 1000`
- `highways[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= city1_i, city2_i <= n - 1`
- `city1_i != city2_i`
- `0 <= toll_i <= 10^5`
- `0 <= discounts <= 500`
- There are no duplicate highways.


## Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict
from numpy import inf
import heapq


class Solution:
    def minimumCost(self, n: int, highways: List[List[int]], discounts: int) -> int:
        # Build Graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for node1, node2, weight in highways:
            graph[node1].append((node2, weight))
            graph[node2].append((node1, weight))

        # Priority Queue
        priority_queue = [(0, 0, 0)]

        # Distance n x (discounts + 1)
        dist = [[inf] * (discounts + 1) for _ in range(n)]

        while priority_queue:
            cost, i, k = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
            if k > discounts:
                continue
            if i == n - 1:
                return cost
            if dist[i][k] > cost:
                dist[i][k] = cost
                for neighbor, weight in graph[i]:
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (cost + weight, neighbor, k))
                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (cost + weight // 2, neighbor, k + 1))

        return -1
```
