# 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

You are given the root of a binary tree.

A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

- Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
- If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.
- Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
- Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.

Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_1_1702.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_2_1702.png)

```
Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Approach 1:

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def longestZigZag(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        longest = 0

        def dfs(root, dir, depth):
            if not root:
                return
            
            nonlocal longest
            longest = max(longest, depth)

            if root.left:
                if dir != "l":
                    dfs(root.left, "l", depth + 1)
                else:
                    dfs(root.left, "l", 1)
                
            if root.right:
                if dir != "r":
                    dfs(root.right, "r", depth + 1)
                else:
                    dfs(root.right, "r", 1)
        
        dfs(root, " ", 0)

        return longest
```

## Approach 2: Concise solution

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def longestZigZag(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        longest = 0

        def dfs(root, left, right):
            nonlocal longest
            longest = max(longest, left, right)

            if root.left:
                dfs(root.left, right + 1, 0)
                
            if root.right:
                dfs(root.right, 0, left + 1)
        
        dfs(root, 0, 0)

        return longest
```
