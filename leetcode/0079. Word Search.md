# 79. Word Search

Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/word-1.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/15/word3.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
``` 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n = board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Could you use search pruning to make your solution faster with a larger `board`?


## Solution: Backtracking

```python3
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        visited = set()

        def dfs(i, j, cnt):
            if cnt == len(word):
                return True

            if (
                0 <= i < len(board)
                and 0 <= j < len(board[0])
                and board[i][j] == word[cnt]
                and (i, j) not in visited
            ):
                visited.add((i, j))

                if (
                    dfs(i - 1, j, cnt + 1)
                    or dfs(i + 1, j, cnt + 1)
                    or dfs(i, j - 1, cnt + 1)
                    or dfs(i, j + 1, cnt + 1)
                ):
                    return True

                visited.remove((i, j))
            return False

        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if dfs(i, j, 0):
                    return True

        return False
```
