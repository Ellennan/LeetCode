# 10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:
- `'.'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the **entire** input string (not partial).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= p.length <= 30`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.
- It is guaranteed for each appearance of the character `'*'`, there will be a previous valid character to match.

## Approach 1: Recursion

***My Solution***
```python3
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        if len(p) == 0:
            return len(s) == 0
        
        match = False if len(s) == 0 else s[0] == p[0] or p[0] == "."

        if len(p) >= 2 and p[1] == "*":
            return (match and self.isMatch(s[1:], p)) or self.isMatch(s, p[2:])
        else:
            return match and self.isMatch(s[1:], p[1:])
```

***Leetcode Solution***
```python3
class Solution(object):
    def isMatch(self, text, pattern):
        if not pattern:
            return not text

        first_match = bool(text) and pattern[0] in {text[0], '.'}

        if len(pattern) >= 2 and pattern[1] == '*':
            return (self.isMatch(text, pattern[2:]) or
                    first_match and self.isMatch(text[1:], pattern))
        else:
            return first_match and self.isMatch(text[1:], pattern[1:])
```

> **Complexity Analysis**
> 
> - Time Complexity: Let T,P be the lengths of the text and the pattern respectively. In the worst case, a call to `match(text[i:], pattern[2j:])` will be made $\binom{i+j}{i}$ times, and strings of the order O(T - i) and O(P - 2j) will be made. Thus, the complexity has the order $$\sum_{i = 0}^T \sum_{j = 0}^{P/2} \binom{i+j}{i} O(T+P-i-2j).$$ With some effort outside the scope of this article, we can show this is bounded by $$O\big((T+P)2^{T + \frac{P}{2}}\big).$$
> 
> - Space Complexity: For every call to match, we will create those strings as described above, possibly creating duplicates. If memory is not freed, this will also take a total of $$O\big((T+P)2^{T + \frac{P}{2}}\big)$$ space, even though there are only order $O(T^2 + P^2)$ unique suffixes of P and T that are actually required.

## Approach 2: Dynamic Programming

```python3
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        match = [[False for x in range(len(p)+1)] for x in range(len(s)+1)]
        match[-1][-1] = True
        
        for i in range(len(s), -1, -1):
            for j in range(len(p)-1, -1, -1):
                if p[j] == "*":
                    j -= 1    
                first_match = i < len(s) and p[j] in {s[i], '.'}

                if j+1 < len(p) and p[j+1] == '*':
                    match[i][j] = match[i][j+2] or (first_match and match[i+1][j])
                else:
                    match[i][j] = first_match and match[i+1][j+1]
                    
        return match[0][0]
```
