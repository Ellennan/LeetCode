# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**  
Input: s = "abcabcbb"  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.  

### Solution
```python3
# sliding window
# time complexity: O(n)

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        largest = 0
        hashmap = {}
        i = -1
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[j] in hashmap:
                i = max(i, hashmap[s[j]])
            largest = max(largest, j - i)
            hashmap[s[j]] = j
        
        return largest
```
