# 455. Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Example 1:**  
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.  
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.  
You need to output 1.

### Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findContentChildren(self, g, s):
        """
        :type g: List[int]
        :type s: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        
        i, j, output = 0, 0, 0
        while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
            if g[i] <= s[j]:
                i += 1
                output += 1
            j += 1
        
        return output
```
