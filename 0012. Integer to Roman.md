# 12. Integer to Roman

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 3999`


## Direct Solution

```python3
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        ret = list()
        while (num//1000 > 0):
            ret.append("M")
            num -= 1000
        while (num//900 > 0):
            ret.append("CM")
            num -= 900
            
        while (num//500 > 0):
            ret.append("D")
            num -= 500
        while (num//400 > 0):
            ret.append("CD")
            num -= 400
            
        while (num//100 > 0):
            ret.append("C")
            num -= 100
        while (num//90 > 0):
            ret.append("XC")
            num -= 90
        
        while (num//50 > 0):
            ret.append("L")
            num -= 50
        while (num//40 > 0):
            ret.append("XL")
            num -= 40
        
        while (num//10 > 0):
            ret.append("X")
            num -= 10
        while (num//9 > 0):
            ret.append("IX")
            num -= 9
        
        while (num//5 > 0):
            ret.append("V")
            num -= 5
        while (num//4 > 0):
            ret.append("IV")
            num -= 4
        
        while (num//1 > 0):
            ret.append("I")
            num -= 1
        
        return "".join(ret)

        for i in range(len(symbols)):
            if num//values[i]:
                count = num//values[i]
                ret += symbols[i] * count
                num -= values[i] * count
