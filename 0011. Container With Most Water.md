# 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i<sup>th</sup> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

*Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.*

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.
 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- ```n == height.length```
- ```2 <= n <= 10^5```
- ```0 <= height[i] <= 10^4```

## Solution: Two Pointer Approach

```python3        
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        output = 0
        
        while l < r:
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            output = max(output, area)
            if(height[l] < height[r]):
                l += 1
            else:
                r -=1
            
        return output
```
