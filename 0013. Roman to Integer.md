# 13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Solution

```python3
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        symbols = ["M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"]
        values = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]
        
        output = 0
        str_idx = 0
        symbols_idx = 0
        
        while str_idx < len(s):
            if len(symbols[symbols_idx]) == 1:
                str = s[str_idx]
            else:
                str = s[str_idx:str_idx+2]
            
            if str == symbols[symbols_idx]:
                output += values[symbols_idx]
                str_idx += len(str)
            else:
                symbols_idx += 1
        
        return output
```
