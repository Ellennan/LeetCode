# 8. String to Integer (atoi)

Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:

1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `"123" -> 123`, `"0032" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-2^31` should be clamped to `-2^31`, and integers greater than `2^31 - 1` should be clamped to `2^31 - 1`.
6. Return the integer as the final result.

**Note:**

- Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
- **Do not ignore** any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is 42.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: "   -42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -42" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -42" ("42" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is -42.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], the final result is 4193.
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 200`
- `s` consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (`0-9`), `' '`, `'+'`, `'-'`, and `'.'`.


## My Solution

```python3
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        output = 0
        negative = False
        digit = False
        for i in s:
            if not digit and i == " ":
                pass
            elif not digit and i == "-":
                digit = True
                negative = True
            elif not digit and i == "+":
                digit = True
            elif i.isdigit():
                digit = True
                output = 10 * output + int(i)
            else:
                break
        
        return max(-output, -2**31) if negative else min(output, 2**31 - 1)
```


## Approach 1: Follow the Rules

**How to check overflows/underflows?**

If we were using a `long`, `BigInteger`, or any other numeric data types to store the integers, we could check if the integer exceeds the `32-bit` range, stop building the output number, and return the clamped value.

```
num = num * 10 + digit
if num > 2^31 - 1 then return 2^31 - 1
else if num < -2^31 then return -2^31
```

However, here we will assume our environment doesn't allow us to use these data types which could be a constraint imposed by the interviewer. But we can't directly use a `32-bit` integer to store the final result.

For example, assume currently result is `1000000000` and digit is `1`, we can't append the current digit to result as `10000000001` is more than $2^{31} − 1$. So, performing the `result = result * 10 + digit` operation will result in **Runtime Error**.

Hence, first we need to check if appending the digit to the result is safe or not. If it is safe to append then update the result. Otherwise, handle the overflow/underflow.

**Let's first consider the case for overflow.**

We will denote the maximum 32-bit integer value $2^{31} - 1 = 2147483647$ with **INT_MAX**, and we will append the digits one by one to the final number.

So there could be 3 cases:

- Case 1: If the current number is less than **INT_MAX / 10 = 214748364**, we can append any digit, and the new number will always be less than **INT_MAX**.

```
'214748363' (less than INT_MAX / 10) + '0' = '2147483630' (less than INT_MAX)
'214748363' (less than INT_MAX / 10) + '9' = '2147483639' (less than INT_MAX)
'1' (less than INT_MAX / 10) + '9' = '19' (less than INT_MAX)
```

- Case 2: If the current number is more than **INT_MAX / 10 = 214748364**, appending any digit will result in a number greater than **INT_MAX**.

```
'214748365' + '0' = '2147483650' (more than INT_MAX)
'214748365' + '9' = '2147483659' (more than INT_MAX)
'2147483646' + '8' = '21474836468' (more than INT_MAX)
```

- Case 3: If the current number is equal to **INT_MAX / 10 = 214748364**, we can only append digits from **0-7** such that the new number will always be less than or equal to **INT_MAX**.

```
'214748364' + '0' = '2147483640' (which is less than INT_MAX)
'214748364' + '7' = '2147483647' (which is equal to INT_MAX)
'214748364' + '8' = '2147483648' (which is more than INT_MAX)
```

**Similarly for underflow.**

The minimum 32-bit integer value is $-2^{31} = −2147483648$ denote it with **INT_MIN**.

We append the digits one by one to the final number.

Just like before, there could be 3 cases:

- Case 1: If the current number is greater than **INT_MIN / 10 = -214748364**, then we can append any digit and the new number will always be greater than **INT_MIN**.

- Case 2: If the current number is less than **INT_MIN / 10 = -214748364**, appending any digit will result in a number less than INT_MIN.

- Case 3: If the current number is equal to **INT_MIN / 10 = -214748364**, then we can only append digits from **0-8**, such that the new number will always be greater than or equal to **INT_MIN**.

Notice that **cases 1 and 2** are similar for overflow and underflow. The only difference is **case 3**: for overflow, we can append any digit between **0 and 7**, but for underflow, we can append any digit between **0 and 8**.

So we can combine both the underflow and overflow checks as follows:

- Initially, store the sign for the final result and consider only the absolute values to build the integer and return the final result with a correct sign at the end.
- If the current number is less than **214748364 = (INT_MAX / 10)**, we can append the next digit.
- If the current number is greater than **214748364**:
    - And, the sign for the result is **'+'**, then the result will **overflow**, so return **INT_MAX**;
    - Or, the sign for the result is **'-'**, then the result will **underflow**, so return **INT_MIN**.
- If the current number is equal to **214748364**:
    - If the next digit is between **0-7**, the result will always be in range.
    - If, next digit is **8**:
        - and the sign is **'+'** the result will **overflow**, so return **INT_MAX**;
        - if the sign is **'-'**, the result will not **underflow** but will still be equal to INT_MIN, so that we can return **INT_MIN**.
    - But if, the next digit is greater than **8**:
        - and the sign is **'+'** the result will **overflow**, so return **INT_MAX**;
        - if the sign is **'-'**, the result will **underflow**, so return **INT_MIN**.

> **Note:** We do not need to handle **0-7** for positive and **0-8** for negative integers separately. If the sign is **negative** and the current number is **214748364**, then appending the digit **8**, which is more than **7**, will also lead to the same result, i.e., **INT_MIN**.

### Implementation

```python3
class Solution:
    def myAtoi(self, s: str) -> int:
        sign = 1
        result = 0
        index = 0
        n = len(s)
        
        INT_MAX = pow(2,31) - 1 
        INT_MIN = -pow(2,31)
        
        # Discard all spaces from the beginning of the input string.
        while index < n and s[index] == ' ':
            index += 1
        
        # sign = +1, if it's positive number, otherwise sign = -1. 
        if index < n and s[index] == '+':
            sign = 1
            index += 1
        elif index < n and s[index] == '-':
            sign = -1
            index += 1
        
        # Traverse next digits of input and stop if it is not a digit. 
        # End of string is also non-digit character.
        while index < n and s[index].isdigit():
            digit = int(s[index])
            
            # Check overflow and underflow conditions. 
            if ((result > INT_MAX // 10) or (result == INT_MAX // 10 and digit > INT_MAX % 10)):
                # If integer overflowed return 2^31-1, otherwise if underflowed return -2^31.    
                return INT_MAX if sign == 1 else INT_MIN
            
            # Append current digit to the result.
            result = 10 * result + digit
            index += 1
        
        # We have formed a valid number without any overflow/underflow.
        # Return it after multiplying it with its sign.
        return sign * result
```

## Approach 2: Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)

We can develop a simple state machine where we give the input string characters one by one as the input to the machine and it will produce the desired integer as output.

We can say, initially we are in some starting state and each time we read a character in the input string, we either stay in the current state or transition to a new state. If at any step the state becomes invalid (i.e. when a non-digit character is spotted, or the 32-bit signed integer range is reached) then we can stop building the integer.

The following diagram presents a common way to write these if-else conditions.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize three variables:
    - `currentState` (to represent current state) as `q0`
    - `result` (to store result till now) as `0`
    - `sign` (to represent the sign of the final result) as `1`
2. For each character of the input string, if the current state is not `qd`:
    - If the current state is `q0`:
        - Stay in the same state if whitespaces occur.
        - If a sign occurs, change the sign variable to `-1` if it's a negative sign and change the state to `q1`.
        - If a digit occurs, append the current digit to the resulting number (clamp result if needed) and change the state to `q2`.
        - If anything else occurs, then stop building the number and transition to state `qd`.
    - If the current state is `q1`:
        - If a digit occurs, append the current digit to the resulting number (clamp result if needed) and change the state to `q2`.
        - If anything else occurs, stop building the result number and transition to state `qd`.
    - If the current state is `q2`:
        - If a digit occurs, append the current digit to the resulting number (clamp result if needed) and stay in the current state.
        - Anything else after a digit character will not be valid; hence, stop building the number and transition to state `qd`.
3. Return the final result with the respective sign, `result * sign`.
